I was tired of the limitations and clutter of online CV makers, so I decided to create my own CV directly in HTML. This approach gives me full control over the design, content, and privacy of my personal information. Building it from scratch was refreshingly straightforward and let me focus on what matters most. 

Sometimes, the simplest solution is just to do it yourself.
